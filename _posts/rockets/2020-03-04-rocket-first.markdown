A successful set of rocket launches! A lot learned and much to consider for the next project.

Our first rocket was called Sandhawk and was built from a kit. We assembled it eagerly, and waited for the moment when we could launch it.

Finally, in January, the big day arrived! We drove to a field in the middle of Warwickshire, and asked the members of the Black Knights Rockets Club if they could teach us how to launch rockets safely. They gladly obliged, and after having checked over the airframe to make sure that we had asssembled it correctly, they showed us how to roll and pack the parachute, along with how to prepare the motor for launch. We slid the Sandhawk down the launchrod onto the launchpad, and after a short countdown, we pressed the ignition button...

A jet of flame shot out of the exhaust as the motor ignited, and then roughly half a second later the Sandhawk soared skywards. We craned our necks and strained our eyes, trying to track its movement, hoping it wouldn't disappear into the clouds. I lost sight of it momentarily, then we saw the parachute come out, and the rocket floated down into the neighbouring field. We sprinted into the field, taking care not to slip and fall in the mud - upon reaching the rocket, we saw that it had landed safely, so we picked it up and carefully carried it back.

We had successfully launched and recovered our first rocket! A short while later on the same day, we attempted another launch. We got everything ready, taking care to try and follow all that we had been shown for the first launch. Again, after a brief countdown, we pressed the ignition button. Again, a jet of flame shot out of the exhaust and the Sandhawk shot into the sky. We tracked it as best we could but the clouds were low that day so we lost sight of the rocket fairly quickly. We all waited for the rocket to come back down out of the clouds, hopefully gently descending on a parachute. 

Unfortunately, the parachute had not deployed - we later discovered that we had packed it a little bit too tightly - so the Sandhawk came back to earth a bit faster than on the first attempt. It landed in a field some distance away from the launchsite, so we all had to go on a bit of a cross-country run in order to recover it! Fortunately, when we arrived the damage was not too severe - one of the fins had slipped out of the cut-out in the tube but apart from that, no major damage had been caused. We have repaired the Sandhawk and are now waiting for the next opportunity to launch again!

Lessons learned:

- Fields in January are very cold and muddy - remember to wear lots of layers!
- Take care to not pack the parachute too tightly - it will not deploy if you do so!
- Remember to bring tools with you
- Masking tape has a surprisingly large number of uses in amateur rocketry!

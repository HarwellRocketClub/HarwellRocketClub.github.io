Vicky works in the communications team at STFC RAL Space, helping to run the engagement and outreach programme. Her background is in Astrophysics, having graduated in 2018 with MPhys Physics and Astronomy from Durham University. She also has teaching experience and a flair for languages (German, Spanish, French, Russian) which led her to pursue working abroad and spending a year in the Netherlands with the European Space Agency as a Young Graduate Trainee for Didactics related to Space Technology. Translation: she worked in the Education Office developing resources, challenges and teacher trainings for schools across Europe, using space as the context to teach STEM.

Her experience collaborating with the likes of astronauts Tim Peake and Alexander Gerst motivated her to return to the UK to bring back and develop best practices in STEM outreach and education. Currently she is helping develop a new citizen science project on the Zooniverse app. The ultimate goal is to improve STEM education, making it accessible to all children and do so with inspiration from the solar system, Milky Way, and beyond.

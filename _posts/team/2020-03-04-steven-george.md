Steve works as a space systems engineer at STFC RAL Space, after graduating with an MSc Astronautics & Space Engineering at Cranfield University (2019) and an MSci (Hons) Physics from Nottingham Trent University (2016). During his time at university, Steve led Cranfield’s student engineering society, CranSEDS, into international & national competitions, which then led to being elected to the executive committee of UKSEDS (2019). 

Prior to his career with the Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC), Steve was voluntarily involved in the national charity ‘UK Students for the Exploration and Development of Space’ as executive committee, and led a local branch in international engineering competitions. He still voluntarily collaborates with the community, but now works closely with SGAC Ethics & Human Rights project group and exhibits a strong ambition to play an active role in sustainable development through the use of Earth Observation, especially for emerging countries.

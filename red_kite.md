RedKite is a series of high power rockets; each building upon the previous one until we reach our three year objective to deliver a sounding rocket that can deploy scientific payloads to approx. 1-3km altitude. RedKite is initially envisioned to be a platform for students to launch their own science payloads, and expose them to real engineering situations and hands-on projects. RedKite will also act as an ambassador for HarwellRocketClub. 

The series of rockets will be used in our outreach strategy, with the intention to inspire children, students and adults of all ages and backgrounds. The name was suggested by the RAL Space communications team. RedKite follows the bird theme of previous UK rockets, and can also be found in the skies here at Harwell. The name choice also represents the rebirth of the UK rocketry industry following the near extinction of the RedKite bird, which resiliently bounced back.
